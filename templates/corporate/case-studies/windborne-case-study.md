How can a scrappy startup help mitigate the most immediately destructive aspects
of climate change? [WindBorne](https://windbornesystems.com/) is advancing
humanity's ability to predict the weather — from hurricanes to heatwaves — and
thus manage its impacts.

Zulip has been WindBorne's irreplaceable hub for coordinating work
that ranges from balloon launches around the globe to developing
state-of-the-art AI models.

> “All our digital communication flows through Zulip… We have three deep
> learning channels, each with twenty active topics a day. No other chat system
> could support that.”

## “We were addicted to Slack”

When WindBorne co-founders started the company in 2019, Slack was the obvious
choice for their team chat. The team had met as Stanford undergrads, launching
high-altitude balloons with the [SSI](https://www.stanfordssi.org/) engineering
student group. “All the WindBorne cofounders were addicted to SSI's Slack — we
loved it,” says John Dean, WindBorne's co-founder and CEO.

The delight didn't last. The company's 12-person team was trying to use chat for
serious technical discussions, and Slack's user experience didn't feel so great
for that purpose. “With overlapping conversations, there was no way to make it
work. Slack threads are trying to solve a real problem, but solving it in a bad
way,” says John.

“Over 2019 and 2020, Slack got worse and worse,” John recalls. “I was using it
in Firefox on Linux, and things would just hang.” When Slack had outages, the
entire team's work would be disrupted for hours.

## “Oh my god, this is awesome”

When John discovered Zulip, its topic-based threading felt like the right
solution to Slack's messiness. After giving the app a try [in the Zulip
development community](https://chat.zulip.org/?show_try_zulip_modal), WindBorne
opted to host their own Zulip instance. (Never again will they have to rely on
an external vendor to manage their critical communication infrastructure.)

“After a couple of days, I thought: `Oh my god, this is awesome. How on earth
would you *not* use Zulip?'” John says. “It was so much easier to communicate.”

Zulip's threading model was transformative, but John also appreciated other
touches. “[Zulip linkifiers](https://zulip.com/help/add-a-custom-linkifier) are
amazing,” John says. In WindBorne's Zulip, “W-” followed by a balloon's ID
number auto-links to that balloon's mission page, and “/live” goes to a live
map of balloon locations.

WindBorne's Head of Global Launch Operations Nathan Kaplan experienced a similar
revelation when he joined the company in 2023.  “My previous company used Slack,
and they required threads for everything. It was a complete mess,” Nathan says.
“Zulip took some getting used to, but after two weeks, it was so much better
than anything I'd used before.”

## Communication hub for coordinating dozens of contractors worldwide

    Nathan travels around the world to manage WindBorne's balloon
    launch sites — he's onboarded dozens of international contractors
    who run WindBorne's launch operations.
    <br/><br/>
    Nathan designed a streamlined experience for coordinating contractors, with Zulip as the hub.
    <br/><br/>
    “80 to 90 percent of the work a contractor does happens within their launch
    support channel on Zulip,” Nathan explains. “A big “aha” moment for them is
    knowing what they need to launch based on messages in the “launch planning”
    topic from the last few days, without having to do a bunch of scrolling.”

Zulip also serves as a rapid prototyping platform to try out and refine
workflows before implementing them in WindBorne's dedicated launch management
product. Last year, Nathan used Zulip to develop a workflow for uploading photos
of balloon sensor bags. Only once requirements were clear did the team kick off
a major engineering project to build uploads into the launch management app.

## The perfect platform for LLM bots

Zulip is a communal playground for WindBorne's team to try out new ideas. Using
Zulip's [bot API](https://zulip.com/api/running-bots), they built bots that
provide daily conversation summaries, post pull request reviews, and (more
whimsically) generate images of landscapes with balloons.

Zulip has been perfect for managing context for LLM bots: “If you integrate an
LLM bot into Slack, you can't manage its context window — off-topic messages can
poison the context,” John explains. “With Zulip, you can always just start a new
topic, and move messages around as needed.” John even uses a personal Zulip
instance as a note-taking app with integrated LLMs.

The team can experiment freely together without disrupting anyone's work: it's
easy to [mute](https://zulip.com/help/mute-a-topic) bot conversations you aren't
interested in. WindBorne
[allows](https://zulip.com/help/restrict-message-editing-and-deletion#configure-message-deletion-permissions)
any employee to delete messages to clear out experiments that didn't work out.
(Server administrators can review the activity log to make sure this permission
is not abused.)
